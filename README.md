# Update bot

Proof of concept for a simple GitHub Actions workflow to bump `uv` lockfile
versions.

## Motivation

At time of writing (23rd October 2024), Dependabot does not support `uv` as a
package ecosystem. However, the behaviour of PRs to version bump dependencies,
especially relating to security vulnerabilities, is still very desirable.

Whilst there is [ongoing work](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10039)
[to support this](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/10478),
it is not ready yet. There are also some other solutions around this suggested
[in the uv docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/dependency-bots/)
for this functionality, such as using an alternative like
[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate). However, Renovate has
compromises such as being non-native to GitHub and
[requiring complicated configuration](https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/running/).

In the meantime, a small GitHub Actions workflow to approximate the
functionality in a lightweight way is a helpful thing to have.

## Workflow

The workflow to create pull requests to bump lockfile versions is shown in its
entirety below, duplicated from [`.github/workflows/update-bot.yaml`](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/update-bot/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-bot.yaml):

```yaml
name: update-bot

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  # Set the schedule, for example every week at 8:00am on Monday
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 8 * * 1

permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  lock:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v3

      - run: |
          echo "\`\`\`" > uv_output.md
          uv lock --update &>> uv_output.md
          echo "\`\`\`" >> uv_output.md

      - name: Create pull request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v7
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          commit-message: Update uv lockfile
          title: Update uv lockfile
          body-path: uv_output.md
          branch: update-uv
          base: main
          labels: install
          delete-branch: true
          add-paths: uv.lock
```

## Usage

1. In your repository's "Settings>Actions>General" menu (<https://github.com/USER/REPO/settings/actions>),
   select the "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" checkbox
   at the bottom of the page
2. Copy the workflow YAML file shown above to `.github/workflows/update-bot.yaml`

That's it! The workflow will automagically run on a cron schedule, creating
a PR to version bump your `uv` dependencies. An example PR generated by the
action on this demo repo is available
[here](https://github.com/EdmundGoodman/update-bot/pull/3), and shown in the
screenshot below:

In combination with GitHub Actions running your test suite against PRs, you
should be able to merge them with confidence!

## Providence

This workflow was created to fill the need identified in the
[xDSL project when switching to uv](https://github.com/xdslproject/xdsl/pull/3294#pullrequestreview-2364817663).

Some other [workflows to perform a similar task](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/pull/5422/files#diff-7d4a36230fcdffc1f740d6dee07ed4c50c4dbc6874d26515a7649c089ede1bb7)
([blog post here](https://browniebroke.com/blog/keep-uv.lock-file-up-to-date-with-dependabot-updates/))
have been created, but these directly commit to the main branch, which could
result in broken code on the release branch if the dependencies change in an
unexpected way.

The mechanism for pull requesting the change rather than directly committing it
was [shown here](https://pixi.sh/dev/advanced/updates_github_actions/), but
targeting a different package manager
